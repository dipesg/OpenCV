**Today I learned how face is detected by using CASCADE CLASSIFIER and detectMultiScale.**
 - I have provided a python file above you can run this file in your system by:
   - ```python detect_faces.py -h``` It will display the way you should approach to get result.
   - Required ```haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml``` is attached in the repo.

 - Using ```from imutils.video import VideoStream``` and openCV I have successfully detected faces using webcam.
